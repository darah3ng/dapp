## Why SBT?

Because the more you own, the more your wrickle brain will become smoother.

## But really, WHY?

Okay, I was kidding. I built this token to get a good understanding of the followings:
- Create a token using Solidity
- Use hardhat as a development enviroment
- Create, test, and deploy smart contracts

## How

The app comes with a friendly/simple interface where you can:
- Add the token to your MetaMask
- Swap your ETH for SBT (one way ONLY)
- Send your SBT to your friends

## Features

Import token to your MetaMask wallet
